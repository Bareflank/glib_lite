## Description

This repo contains a lite version of glib that only contains ghash, glist,
gslist, gqueue and gmem. The was created to support [LibVMI](http://libvmi.com/)
on systems that cannot support a full GLib including the
[Bareflank Hypervisor](http://bareflank.github.io/hypervisor/), and Unikernels
like [IncludeOS](http://www.includeos.org/).
